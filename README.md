Hello there, this is a basic cookie cutter application that I completed as an assignment from a bootcamp I used to attend and now work at. 

This isn't my best piece of work, but it is the only one I have currently deployed and running due to billing. Everyone know what happens if you leave an open Ec2 instance too long. You would have to take a second mortgage out on your house to pay back Bezos. So, no thank you.

But, this project is used to keep track of a teams' players and there playing statuses in any given game. I used full stack MERN for this application, but am just as familiar with full-stack Python-Flask and Java-SpringBoot.

Thank you and I hope you liked this rambling...
